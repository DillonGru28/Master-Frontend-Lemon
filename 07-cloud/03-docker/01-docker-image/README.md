# 01 Use docker image

In this example we are going to create and run Docker images.

We will start from `01-production-bundle`.

# Steps to build it

- `npm install` to install previous sample packages:

```bash
npm install
```

- We will use same approach as `Github Actions` example, but we will Heroku and Docker.

- First, we need to create a Docker image, we will check availables images in [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/). You can create a free account. In this case, we will use [the alpine version of nodejs image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node):

_Dockerfile_

```Docker

```

> You can use [Docker VSCode extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview)
